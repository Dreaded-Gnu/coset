## Code style guide

- Use 2 spaces for tabs, never tab characters.
- No trailing whitespace and consecutive blank lines, blank lines should have no whitespace.
- Always favor strict equals `===` unless you *need* to use type coercion.
- Follow conventions already in the code, and listen to tslint.
- **Ensure changes are tslint validated.**
- After making a change be sure to run the test process to ensure that you didn't break anything. You can do this with `npm test` from root project folder which will execute the test suite of all packages.
